# 🌍 Stand For Humanity

> A community-led movement to stand against oppression, injustice, and war — through open source, awareness, and peaceful resistance.

---

## ✊ Our Mission

We believe **every human has the right to live in peace and dignity**, regardless of nationality, religion, or race. We stand against **war, apartheid, ethnic cleansing**, and the suppression of basic human rights.

This initiative brings together developers, designers, activists, and global citizens to:

- 💻 Create impactful content (READMEs, banners, social media kits)
- 📢 Spread awareness across GitHub and other platforms
- 🤝 Support ethical tech and boycott products that fund violence
- 🕊️ Stand in solidarity with the oppressed — in **Palestine**, **Sudan**, **Congo**, **Yemen**, **Kashmir**, and beyond.

## 📚 How You Can Help
